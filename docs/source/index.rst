AIMotionLab-Virtual documentation
=================================

This is the documentation for the aiml_virtual package, auto-generated from docstrings. The legacy simulator's
documentation is available on the `github wiki <https://github.com/AIMotionLab-SZTAKI/AIMotionLab-Virtual/wiki>`_.
The structure of this documentation mimics the structure of the aiml_vitual package itself: each package may have
modules (.py files) and further subpackages. You can navigate between these packages and subpackages using the sidebar,
until you find the module (.py file) you are interested in. Each module has a separate documentation page.
The underlying python source code is also accessible from each module's documentation page.
If you want to know how to use the aiml_virtual package in broad strokes, take a look at the scripts/examples folder,
where the scripts form a tutorial explaining the capabilities of the package
